                    I am a 5th year CS student in his last semester at U of A, and I am 23 years old. I am currently working towards a Bachelors of Science Degree with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. I love music, I've been playing piano and singing since I was 4. Though ever since University I've never really had the time to play much anymore, I still try to get some piano playing in once in a while. I also love to code, although my passion for coding began later in my career than most things, I am continuously trying to catch up with the people who have more experience with me. It is definitely a challenging route, but I am proud of the progress I've made so far, and I won't stop until I become the best there is.

                <p class="professional-history">
                    Aside from my learning in school, I've had some opportunities to work with people directly from the industry. In my 3rd year I got the opportunity to spend 4 months to work with GhostLabs on a contracted project. During this experience I got to work with Javascript/nestJS for frontend, and ExpressJS for backend development. I also had the opportunity to intern for a company called INVIDI Technologies for 16 months. It was truly a wonderful experience, and I wouldn't trade it for anything else.

                <p class="my-offer">
                    My skills lie mainly in the backend development area. I have experience with Python, Javascript, as well as Kotlin for backend. I have lots of experience with AWS, Kubernetes, and dockerization. As a junior software developer, my experience in terms of technology is certainly something I am proud of. I am very good at working with others, and I really enjoy coding, therefore to me it's not just a job, but rather a hobby/enjoyment.
